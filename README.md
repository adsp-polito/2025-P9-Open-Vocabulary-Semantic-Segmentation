## Introduction
### New Task: Open-Vocabulary RSI Semantic Segmantation (OVRSISS)
![](assets/motivation.png)
- OVRSISS aims at segmenting **arbitrary** semantic class in RSI domain. 
- OVRSISS methods need **no finetuning** adapting to **new classes**.

### New Dataset: LandDiscover50K (LD50K)
![](assets/LD50K.png)
- **51,846** RSI images covering **40** diverse semantic classes.
- Building upon established RSISS datasets, including [OEM](), [LoveDA](), [DeepGlobe](), [SAMRS](). For further details, please refer to the paper.
- Elevates the performance of OVRSISS by providing **large-scale**, **multi-domain**, **multi-granularity** RSI images with comprehensive class annotations.


### New Approach: GSNet (Generalist and Specialist Network)
![](assets/framework.png)
- Dual-Stream Image Encoder
  - Generalist: CLIP backbone for **open-vocabulary recognition**.
  - Specialist: RSI backbone for **domain-specific expertise**.
- Query-Guided Feature Fusion
  - Efficient Fusion of Generalist and Specialist Features under the guidance of text-based queries.
- Residual Information Preservation Decoder
  - Aggregates multi-source features for more accurate mask
    predictions.
  - Detail refinement and backbone regularization.

## Prepare datasets
### Training Dataset: LD50K
- Download LandDiscover50K from this [hugginface repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Stev929/LandDiscover50K)
- Extract the complete zip file
    ```bash
    7z x LD50KSplit.zip
    ```
### Testing Datasets: FloodNet, FLAIR, FAST, Potsdam
- We provide pre-processed test images and masks for users' convenience. Download them from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Stev929/OVRSISS_test/tree/main).
- For pre-process of the testing datasets, check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19492).

## Installation
An example of installation is shown below:
```
git clone https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.git
cd GSNet
conda create -n gsnet python=3.8
conda activate gsnet
conda install pytorch==2.3.0 torchvision==0.18.0 torchaudio==2.3.0 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Linux with Python ≥ 3.8 required
- Ensure that the versions of PyTorch, TorchVision, and Detectron2 are compatible. For more information, refer to [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) and the  [Detectron2 install guide](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html).

## Training and Evaluation

- Download the pretrained [Specialist RSI Backbone weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kH0wDM_Hl4sEQJG8JjILCo0RTx65X7zV/view?usp=sharing).
